representation of 3d poses as elements of lie-algebras (sec 2.1)
derive direct image alignment as weighted least-squares minimization on lie-manifolds (sec 2.2)
propagation of uncertainty (sec 2.3)

bold/capital - matrices
bold/lower - vectors
[.]_n - nth row of matrix
I : Ω -> R - Images
D : Ω -> R - per-pixel inverse depth map
V : Ω -> R - inverse depth variance
Ω ⊂ R^2 - set of normalized pixel coordinates

notes:
- CPU SIMD: AVX2/AVX-512 (or NEON) for residuals/gradients
- CUDA specifics: texture memory for warps, shared-mem tiling for Jacobians, warp-level reductions, streams for overlap, pinned & page-locked host buffers
